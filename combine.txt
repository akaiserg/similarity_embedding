1. Equal Weights Combination (50-50 split between semantic and Levenshtein):
```python
Combined score: 0.6442
- Semantic: 0.8465 (high semantic similarity)
- Levenshtein: 0.4419 (moderate string similarity)
```
This balanced approach shows that while the sentences mean almost the same thing (0.8465), they have significant character-level differences (0.4419).

2. Custom Weights Combination (60% semantic, 20% TF-IDF, 20% cosine):
```python
Combined score: 0.6043
- Semantic: 0.8465 (high semantic similarity)
- TF-IDF: 0.2095 (low term frequency similarity)
- Cosine: 0.2727 (low word overlap similarity)
```
This weighting emphasizes meaning over exact word matches, which is why the combined score is still relatively high despite low TF-IDF and cosine scores.

3. Adaptive Combination:
```python
Combined score: 0.5234
Weights used:
- Semantic: 40%
- Levenshtein: 20%
- TF-IDF: 20%
- Cosine: 20%
```
The adaptive method chose a balanced weight distribution because:
- The texts have similar lengths
- There's moderate word overlap
- The meaning is similar but vocabulary differs

Recommendations for choosing weights:

1. For meaning-focused comparison:
```python
methods=['semantic', 'tfidf']
weights=[0.8, 0.2]
```

2. For exact matching:
```python
methods=['levenshtein', 'cosine']
weights=[0.7, 0.3]
```

3. For balanced comparison:
```python
methods=['semantic', 'levenshtein', 'tfidf', 'cosine']
weights=[0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
```
