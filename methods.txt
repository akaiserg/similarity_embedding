String-Based Methods


Useful for: Exact matches, typos, minor variations


Levenshtein distance: Good for spell checking and finding typos


Longest Common Subsequence: Good for finding shared sequences



Token-Based Methods


Useful for: Word-level similarities, document classification

Semantic Methods (Embeddings)


Useful for: Understanding meaning, regardless of exact wording

Sentence Transformers: Best for semantic similarity

Universal Sentence Encoder: Good for multilingual comparison


Here's when to use each approach:

Use String-Based Methods when:


You need exact matching
Looking for typos or minor variations
Speed is crucial
Working with very short texts


Use Token-Based Methods when:


You want to find shared vocabulary
Working with technical documents
Need interpretable results
Computing resources are limited


Use Semantic Methods when:


Understanding meaning is crucial
Comparing conceptually similar but differently worded texts
Working with multiple languages
Need high-quality results and have computational resources

Example decision process:
pythonCopydef choose_comparison_method(text1, text2, criteria):
    if criteria.get('exact_match'):
        return string_similarity(text1, text2)
    elif criteria.get('speed_critical'):
        return token_similarity(text1, text2)
    elif criteria.get('semantic_understanding'):
        return embedding_similarity(text1, text2)
Practical recommendations:

For short texts (< 50 characters):

Start with Levenshtein distance
Use embeddings if meaning is crucial


For medium texts (50-1000 characters):

Start with token-based methods
Use embeddings if computational resources allow


For long texts (>1000 characters):

Use a combination of methods
TF-IDF for initial filtering
Embeddings for final ranking
